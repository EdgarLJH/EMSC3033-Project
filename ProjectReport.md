# EMSC4033 - Project Report 

The aim of this project was to produce a python notebook that calculates the geodesic distances between a set of coordinates and a pre-defined lithospheric thickness. The statistical significance of this spatial relationship will then be evaluated against random locations using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test.

## Instructions

The user would only have to define a lithospheric thickness, z, in km at the beginning of the notebook, as well as select an ASCII file of data points to read in. 

## Dependencies
